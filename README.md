This project builds a Shiny visualisation for data on dog agility results found at [https://baddogagility.com/category/power60/].

This project is composed of two R code files:

1. 1_Data.R extracts the data from the website for 2018 quarters 1 and 2. Saves final data set under AgilityData.RData.

2. 2_Shinyapp.R cleans the data and creates the Shiny app.
